    h5 End Time
    p In order to better serve you, please keep in mind the “end time” of your party. Due to sequential bookings of parties during peak times (Friday and Saturday and especially during the holiday season), we require that our guests adhere to the end time of their party so that our staff may prepare the room for the next party. You will be charged a late fee of $50.00 if your party exceeds the end time by more than 10 minutes.
    h5 Payments and Billing
    p A 50% installment (of the minimum food and beverage charge) will be required one week prior to your event.. Your final bill will be the minimum food and beverage charge plus tax and a 20% gratuity. If your bill exceeds the minimum food and beverage charge as defined above, then you will be charged the actual amount of the food and beverage purchases, plus tax and a 20% gratuity Credit card payments only. No personal checks are accepted.
    h5 Inclement Weather
    p For the Front Street Bar and Grill, please be aware that we do not have any contingency plans for inclement weather. We do have suspended patio umbrellas and patio heaters for your comfort.
    h5 Menus and Pricing
    p At times the menus and pricing are subject to change. If your previous selections have been replaced, we will work with you to select an alternate substitution. Pricing will revert to the most current pricing.
